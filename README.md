# AI Librarian Research Project

This project aims to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of various Generative AI models in enhancing library services, particularly in answering complex queries and creating study plans using library resources.

## Project Overview

The research focuses on:
- Comparing different AI models (both open-source and closed-source) in library-related tasks
- Evaluating AI performance against traditional library services
- Analyzing cost-effectiveness and safety considerations
- Creating a framework for AI-assisted library services

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configurations
```
